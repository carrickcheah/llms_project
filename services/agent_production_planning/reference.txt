# ⏺ The code uses these main architectural patterns:
#   1. Data Pipeline Pattern:
#     - Load data from Excel → Clean/transform → Build scheduling model → Generate schedule → Visualize

#   2. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP):
#     - Uses Google OR-Tools' CP-SAT solver to find optimal schedules
#     - Defines variables (job start/end times), constraints (no overlaps, due dates), and objectives (minimize makespan)

#   3. Fallback Strategy Pattern:
#     - Primary algorithm: CP-SAT constraint solver (complex, optimal)
#     - Fallback algorithm: Greedy scheduler (simpler, less optimal)

#   4. Defensive Programming:
#     - Extensive input validation and error handling
#     - Guards against missing/invalid data (dates, machine IDs, durations)
#     - Type coercion for mixed data types

#   5. Factory Method Pattern:
#     - Functions generate complex objects (jobs, machines, setup times)
#     - Encapsulates creation logic separately from usage

#   6. Domain Model:
#     - Jobs, machines, and schedules as core domain concepts
#     - Clear representation of manufacturing scheduling domain

#   7. Visualization Strategy:
#     - Transforms schedule data into visual Gantt chart representation

#   This architecture balances optimization needs, error handling, 
#   and performance constraints when dealing with real-world manufacturing data.



# ⏺ Yes, suitable for production with these improvements:
#   1. Add unit/integration tests
#   2. Implement proper logging instead of print statements
#   3. Add configuration file for parameters (max_jobs, horizon, etc.)
#   4. Improve error handling with better recovery mechanisms
#   5. Add data validation before processing
#   6. Create a proper CLI interface or web UI
#   7. Implement caching for better performance
#   8. Add documentation and user manual
