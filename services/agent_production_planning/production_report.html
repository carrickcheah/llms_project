            The output you provided appears to be a log or report of some kind, possibly generated by a monitoring tool or system. It contains information about the utilization of two virtual machines (VMs), VM03 and VM04, over a certain period of time. The data includes the number of jobs run on each machine, the total duration of those jobs, the working time, idle time, and overall utilization percentage.<br><br>For VM03, the log shows that there were 4 jobs run with a total duration of 201 hours and 58 minutes. The working time was 174 hours and 23 minutes, which means the machine was working for about 72% of the total time. The idle time was 27 hours and 29 minutes, or about 13% of the total time. The overall utilization percentage for VM03 was 85%.<br><br>For VM04, the log shows that there were 6 jobs run with a total duration of 888 hours and 54 minutes. The working time was 634 hours and 17 minutes, which means the machine was working for about 72% of the total time. The idle time was 254 hours and 36 minutes, or about 29% of the total time. The overall utilization percentage for VM04 was 71%.<br><br>The log also includes some detailed information about the jobs run on each machine, such as the job ID, the customer ID, the product code, the project type, and the start and end times. However, this information is incomplete and doesn't provide enough context to draw any specific conclusions.
