Yes, you can definitely prepare a script like tools.py to map tool names (or commands) to their corresponding SQL queries. This approach can serve as a lookup table or registry that your LLM system calls when it needs to generate or execute a specific query. Here’s how you might approach it:

1. Using a Dictionary to Map Commands to SQL
You could define a dictionary in tools.py that holds all your tool names as keys and their corresponding SQL statements as values:

python
Copy
# tools.py

TOOLS = {
    "search_hotel": "SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%');",
    "search_hotels_by_location": "SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE location LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%');",
    "book_hotel": "UPDATE hotels SET booked = 1 WHERE id = ?;",
    "update_hotel": (
        "UPDATE hotels "
        "SET checkin_date = STR_TO_DATE(?, '%Y-%m-%d'), "
        "checkout_date = STR_TO_DATE(?, '%Y-%m-%d') "
        "WHERE id = ?;"
    ),
    "cancel_hotel": "UPDATE hotels SET booked = 0 WHERE id = ?;"
}

def get_query(tool_name):
    """Retrieve the SQL query corresponding to the given tool name."""
    return TOOLS.get(tool_name, "Tool not found")
2. Integrating with the LLM
Your system could use the above script in several ways:

Direct Function Call:
Your LLM-based application could identify the tool (e.g., "search_hotel") from the user’s query and then call get_query("search_hotel") to retrieve the associated SQL.

RAG with Dynamic Context:
In a retrieval-augmented generation system, you could include the content of tools.py (or at least its mappings) in your retrieval dataset. Then, once the LLM retrieves the relevant tool information, it can generate the corresponding query. In this case, the output from the LLM might match one of your keys, and you then use that key to look up the SQL in tools.py.

Hybrid Approach:
Use the LLM to generate a candidate tool name or command based on a natural language query. Then, use your script to fetch the SQL statement and, if necessary, let the LLM help fill in parameters dynamically.

3. Benefits of This Approach
Centralized Management:
All SQL queries are maintained in one script. This makes updates and modifications easier.

Dynamic Execution:
The LLM can be used to identify which tool to call, and your script will return the proper query without needing to retrain or hardcode responses within the model.

Flexibility:
You can extend tools.py with additional metadata or even functions to handle parameter substitution, logging, or error handling.

4. Considerations
Parameter Handling:
Ensure that your system correctly handles parameter substitution to prevent SQL injection and to maintain query integrity.

Model Integration:
When letting the LLM “call” your tools, design a clear interface so that the LLM output corresponds exactly to a tool name in your registry. You might define a prompt that instructs the model to return one of the predefined tool names.

Scalability:
This approach works well for a moderate number of tools. If your system grows significantly, you might consider a database or configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON) to manage your tools dynamically.

Summary
Yes, you can prepare a script like tools.py that maps tool names to SQL queries, and then let your LLM-based system call these tools. This provides a centralized and maintainable method to handle SQL query execution, with the LLM helping to decide which tool to use based on user queries.






You said:
give example.
RAG with Dynamic Context:
In a retrieval-augmented generation system, you could include the content of tools.py (or at least its mappings) in your retrieval dataset. Then, once the LLM retrieves the relevant tool information, it can generate the corresponding query. In this case, the output from the LLM might match one of your keys, and you then use that key to look up the SQL in tools.py.
Reasoned for a second
Below is an example workflow using RAG with dynamic context that leverages the content of your tools.py. In this setup, the retrieval component includes tool mappings from your script, and then the generation component outputs a tool key. That key is then used to look up the actual SQL query from your script.

Step 1: Define Your Tools Mapping (tools.py)
python
Copy
# tools.py
TOOLS = {
    "search_hotel": "SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%');",
    "search_hotels_by_location": "SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE location LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%');",
    "book_hotel": "UPDATE hotels SET booked = 1 WHERE id = ?;",
    "update_hotel": (
        "UPDATE hotels SET checkin_date = STR_TO_DATE(?, '%Y-%m-%d'), "
        "checkout_date = STR_TO_DATE(?, '%Y-%m-%d') WHERE id = ?;"
    ),
    "cancel_hotel": "UPDATE hotels SET booked = 0 WHERE id = ?;"
}

def get_query(tool_name):
    """Retrieve the SQL query corresponding to the given tool name."""
    return TOOLS.get(tool_name, "Tool not found")
Step 2: Prepare Your RAG Dataset Including the Tools Mapping
Here’s an example of a JSON dataset entry for RAG. The retrieved_docs field contains the relevant information from your tool mappings (extracted from tools.py), and the answer field shows the expected output, which in this case is the key name.

json
Copy
[
  {
    "query": "I need to search for hotels by name.",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "Tool Mapping:\nKey: search_hotel\nSQL: SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%');\nDescription: Searches hotels whose names match a provided pattern."
    ],
    "answer": "search_hotel"
  },
  {
    "query": "How can I look up hotels based on their location?",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "Tool Mapping:\nKey: search_hotels_by_location\nSQL: SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE location LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%');\nDescription: Retrieves hotels from a specified location."
    ],
    "answer": "search_hotels_by_location"
  },
  {
    "query": "I want to book a hotel by its ID.",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "Tool Mapping:\nKey: book_hotel\nSQL: UPDATE hotels SET booked = 1 WHERE id = ?;\nDescription: Books a hotel by marking it as booked."
    ],
    "answer": "book_hotel"
  }
]
Step 3: Using the RAG System with Dynamic Lookup
User Query:
The user inputs a natural language query, for example:
"I need to search for hotels by name."

Retrieval Component:
The retriever searches your dataset and returns the relevant tool mapping information (as shown in the retrieved_docs field).

Generation Component:
The generator processes the query and the retrieved context, then outputs a tool key, e.g., "search_hotel".

Dynamic Lookup:
Your system receives the key "search_hotel" and calls the function get_query("search_hotel") from tools.py, which returns:

pgsql
Copy
SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%');
Execution:
The system executes the returned SQL query against your database.

Summary
By including the tool mappings in your retrieval dataset and having the LLM generate a corresponding key, you can dynamically look up the precise SQL command in your tools.py script. This approach minimizes hardcoding and allows you to maintain and extend your toolset more easily as your system scales.
